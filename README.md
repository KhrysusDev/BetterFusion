Fusion is absolute fucking dogshit and uses a shitty web framework called Flask which was made as a fucking joke! I have plans to make something 10000000x better than that dogshit. You wanna talk shit behind my back? Your auth is so fucking dogshit people are able to get full account details off your dogshit ass product. I'm honestly suprised you'r e still in business, but I guess we credit that to the retards who think your shit is better eh.

# BetterFusion
Async implementation of FusionAPI. Also all objects have been split into a file, meaning it is obfuscation friendly, and doesn't implement dynamic deserialization at all.
